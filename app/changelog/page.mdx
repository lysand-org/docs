This page lists changes since Working Draft 03. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Since WD 03

- Rewrote the signature system from scratch to be simpler and not depend on dates.
- Moved Likes and Dislikes to an extension.
- Renamed fields on several common entities like [Users](/entities/users) and [Notes](/entities/notes).
- Removed the `Patch` entity.
  - Useless since edits can just be sent to inboxes directly.
- Allowed `uri`s to not contain the entity's `id`.
- Loosened restrictions on the `id` field in entities.
  - Can now be any string, not just a UUID.
- Made `uri` optional in some entities not useful enough to keep track of.
- Added shared inboxes.
- Added `remote` field to [ContentFormat](/structures/content-format).
- Switched to [ThumbHash](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/) from [BlurHash](https://blurha.sh/).
- Added optional identification characters to [Custom Emojis](/structures/emoji).
- Added `manually_approves_followers` to [Users](/entities/users).
- Removed `visibility` from [Notes](/entities/notes).
- Made `subject` optional in [Notes](/entities/notes).
