# WebSockets Extension

<Note>
    This extension is a **draft** and should not be considered final. It is subject to change.

    If testing proves unsuccessful, this draft may be abandoned.
</Note>

Typically, communication between Lysand instances is done via HTTP. However, HTTP suffers from some limitations, such as high latency and heavy overhead for small messages, making it less suitable for exchanging large amounts of entities at acceptable speeds. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This extension aims to address these limitations by adding support for the exchange of entities using WebSockets.

## Message Format

Messages sent over the WebSocket connection are JSON objects.

<Row>
    <Col>
        <Properties>
            <Property name="signature" type="string" required={true}>
                Same as the `X-Signature` header in HTTP requests.
            </Property>
            <Property name="nonce" type="string" required={true}>
                Same as the `X-Nonce` header in HTTP requests.
            </Property>
            <Property name="signed_by" type="URI" required={true}>
                Same as the `X-Signed-By` header in HTTP requests.
            </Property>
            <Property name="entity" type="Entity" required={true} typeLink="/entities/entity">
                Same as the request body in HTTP requests. Must be a string (stringified JSON), not JSON.
            </Property>
        </Properties>
    </Col>
