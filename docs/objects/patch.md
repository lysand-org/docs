# Patch

A `Patch` object is an object that represents a change to a `Note`. It is used to update a `Note`, such as when a spelling mistake is made and needs to be corrected.

`Patch` objects are not meant to be displayed to the user, and are only meant to be used internally by the server.

`Patch` objects **MUST** have a different `id` as the object that they are patching, and **MUST** have a `patched_at` field that contains the date and time that the object was patched. The `id` of the object that is being patched **MUST** be stored in the `patched_id` field.

Subsequent patches are applied to the original object, not to the previous patch. It is up to the server to display the most recent patch it has in storage to the client.

> **Note:**: A `Patch` object must replace the object that it is patching when displayed to the client. As such, if a Patch object is missing some fields from the previous object, these fields should not be displayed to the user

Here is an example `Patch` for the aforementioned object:
```json5
{
    "type": "Patch",
    "id": "4c21fdea-1318-4d14-b3aa-1ac2f3db2e53",
    "uri": "https://example.com/publications/4c21fdea-1318-4d14-b3aa-1ac2f3db2e53",
    "patched_id": "f08a124e-fe90-439e-8be4-15a428a72a19",
    "patched_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "contents": [
        {
            "content": "This is patched!",
            "content_type": "text/plain"
        },
    ],
    // ...
}
```

`Patch`es inherit all other properties from Publications.
